Today it‚Äôs a desktop app that runs models locally or connects to cloud providers. Tomorrow it aims to be a complete ecosystem rivaling platforms like ChatGPT and Claude.\n\nHow is this different from other AI platforms?\n\nOther platforms are models behind APIs you rent. Jan is a complete AI ecosystem you own. Run any model, use real tools through MCP, keep your data private, and never pay subscriptions for local use.\n\nWhat models can I use?\n\n**Jan Models:**\n\n- Jan-Nano (32k/128k) - Research and analysis with MCP integration\n- Lucy - Mobile-optimized search (1.7B)\n- Jan-v1 - Reasoning and tool use (4B)\n\n**Open Source:**\n\n- OpenAI‚Äôs gpt-oss models (120b and 20b)\n- Any GGUF model from Hugging Face\n\n**Cloud (with your API keys):**\n\n- OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Groq, and more\n\nWhat are MCP tools?\n\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI interact with real applications. Instead of just generating text, your AI can create designs in Canva, analyze data in Jupyter, browse the web, and execute code - all through conversation.\n\nIs Jan compatible with my system?\n\n**Supported OS**:\n\n- [Windows 10+](https://docs.jan.ai/docs/desktop/windows#compatibility)\n- [macOS 12+](https://docs.jan.ai/docs/desktop/mac#compatibility)\n- [Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)](https://docs.jan.ai/docs/desktop/linux)\n\n**Hardware**:\n\n- Minimum: 8GB RAM, 10GB storage\n- Recommended: 16GB RAM, GPU (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel/Apple), 50GB storage\n\nHow realistic is ‚Äòopen superintelligence‚Äô?\n\nHonestly? It‚Äôs ambitious and uncertain. We believe the combination of rapidly improving open models, better consumer hardware, community innovation, and specialized models working together can eventually rival closed platforms. But this is a multi-year journey with no guarantees. What we can guarantee is that we‚Äôll keep building in the open, with the community, towards this goal.\n\nWhat can Jan actually do today?\n\nRight now, Jan can:\n\n- Run models like Llama, Mistral, and our own Jan models locally\n- Connect to cloud providers if you want more power\n- Use MCP tools to create designs, analyze data, browse the web, and more\n- Work completely offline once models are downloaded\n- Provide an OpenAI-compatible API for developers\n\nIs Jan really free?\n\n**Local use**: Always free, no catches\n**Cloud models**: You pay providers directly (we add no markup)\n**Jan cloud**: Optional paid services coming 2025\n\nThe core platform will always be free and open source.\n\nHow does Jan protect privacy?\n\n- Runs 100% offline once models are downloaded\n- All data stored locally in [Jan Data Folder](https://docs.jan.ai/docs/data-folder)\n- No telemetry without explicit consent\n- Open source code you can audit\n\nCan I self-host Jan?\n\nYes. Download directly or build from [source](https://github.com/menloresearch/jan). Jan Server for production deployments coming late 2025.\n\nWhen will mobile/web versions launch?\n\n- **Jan Web**: Beta late 2025\n- **Jan Mobile**: Late 2025\n- **Jan Server**: Late 2025\n\nAll versions will sync seamlessly.\n\nHow can I contribute?\n\n- Code: [GitHub](https://github.com/menloresearch/jan)\n- Community: [Discord](https://discord.gg/FTk2MvZwJH)\n- Testing: Help evaluate models and report bugs\n- Documentation: Improve guides and tutorials\n\nAre you hiring?\n\nYes! We love hiring from our community. Check [Careers](https://menlo.bamboohr.com/careers).",

## What is Jan Today

[Section titled ‚ÄúWhat is Jan Today‚Äù](https://docs.jan.ai/#what-is-jan-today)

Jan is an open-source AI platform that runs on your hardware. We believe AI should be in the hands of many, not
controlled by a few tech giants.

Today, Jan is:

- **A desktop app** that runs AI models locally or connects to cloud providers
- **A model hub** making the latest open-source models accessible
- **A connector system** that lets AI interact with real-world tools via MCP

Tomorrow, Jan aims to be a complete ecosystem where open models rival or exceed closed alternatives.

- Richer connector ecosystem
- An evaluation framework to build better models

### The Long-Term Vision

[Section titled ‚ÄúThe Long-Term Vision‚Äù](https://docs.jan.ai/#the-long-term-vision)

We‚Äôre working towards open superintelligence where:

- Open models match or exceed closed alternatives
- Anyone can run powerful AI on their own hardware
- The community drives innovation, not corporations
- AI capabilities are owned by users, not rented

## FAQs

[Section titled ‚ÄúFAQs‚Äù](https://docs.jan.ai/#faqs)

What is Jan?

Jan is an open-source AI platform working towards a viable alternative to Big Tech AI. Today it‚Äôs a desktop app that runs models locally or connects to cloud providers. Tomorrow it aims to be a complete ecosystem rivaling platforms like ChatGPT and Claude.

How is this different from other AI platforms?

Other platforms are models behind APIs you rent. Jan is a complete AI ecosystem you own. Run any model, use real tools through MCP, keep your data private, and never pay subscriptions for local use.

What models can I use?

**Jan Models:**

- Jan-Nano (32k/128k) - Research and analysis with MCP integration
- Lucy - Mobile-optimized search (1.7B)
- Jan-v1 - Reasoning and tool use (4B)

**Open Source:**

- OpenAI‚Äôs gpt-oss models (120b and 20b)
- Any GGUF model from Hugging Face

**Cloud (with your API keys):**

- OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Groq, and more

What are MCP tools?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI interact with real applications. Instead of just generating text, your AI can create designs in Canva, analyze data in Jupyter, browse the web, and execute code - all through conversation.

Is Jan compatible with my system?

**Supported OS**:

- [Windows 10+](https://docs.jan.ai/docs/desktop/windows#compatibility)
- [macOS 12+](https://docs.jan.ai/docs/desktop/mac#compatibility)
- [Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)](https://docs.jan.ai/docs/desktop/linux)

**Hardware**:

- Minimum: 8GB RAM, 10GB storage
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, GPU (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel/Apple), 50GB storage

How realistic is ‚Äòopen superintelligence‚Äô?

Honestly? It‚Äôs ambitious and uncertain. We believe the combination of rapidly improving open models, better consumer hardware, community innovation, and specialized models working together can eventually rival closed platforms. But this is a multi-year journey with no guarantees. What we can guarantee is that we‚Äôll keep building in the open, with the community, towards this goal.

What can Jan actually do today?

Right now, Jan can:

- Run models like Llama, Mistral, and our own Jan models locally
- Connect to cloud providers if you want more power
- Use MCP tools to create designs, analyze data, browse the web, and more
- Work completely offline once models are downloaded
- Provide an OpenAI-compatible API for developers

Is Jan really free?

**Local use**: Always free, no catches
**Cloud models**: You pay providers directly (we add no markup)
**Jan cloud**: Optional paid services coming 2025

The core platform will always be free and open source.

How does Jan protect privacy?

- Runs 100% offline once models are downloaded
- All data stored locally in [Jan Data Folder](https://docs.jan.ai/docs/data-folder)
- No telemetry without explicit consent
- Open source code you can audit

Can I self-host Jan?

Yes. Download directly or build from [source](https://github.com/menloresearch/jan). Jan Server for production deployments coming late 2025.

When will mobile/web versions launch?

- **Jan Web**: Beta late 2025
- **Jan Mobile**: Late 2025
- **Jan Server**: Late 2025

All versions will sync seamlessly.
